<!-- 

class
	The custom class implementing com.myjava.cache.VirtualMemCache, which will be used for item loading
	on cache miss. Required
	
name
	A named identifier for loading the cache class. Required
	
maxEntriesOnHeap
	The maximum number of items to be present in the cache. Adding anymore item will 
	remove the item based on a given eviction strategy. If the item is not expired based on 'timeToLiveSecs',
	it is put into an off-heap location (overflow). Default 1024
	
timeToLiveSecs
	The maximum number of seconds an element can exist in the cache regardless of use. 
	The element expires at this limit and will no longer be returned from the cache. 
	The default value is 0, which means no TTL eviction takes place (infinite lifetime).
	
timeToIdleSecs
	The maximum number of seconds an element can exist in the cache without being accessed. 
	The element expires at this limit and will no longer be returned from the cache. 
	The default value is 0, which means no TTI eviction takes place (infinite lifetime).	
	
useExpiryTimer
	Whether to use an expiration checker thread to remove expired items [true/false]. Default false.
	Expiration does not follow any eviction strategy. If an item is expired based on 'timeToLiveSecs', 
	it is removed from cache; if an item is idled based on 'timeToIdleSecs', it is put into an off-heap location (overflow)
	
expiryTimerIntervalSecs
	If expiration checker thread is used, the interval after which each run will happen. Default 3600.
	
evictionStrategy
	Cache element eviction strategy: LRU,LFU,FIFO,LIFO. Default LRU
	
serializer
	Since we are using offheap memory storage, there is a cost associated with serialization/deserialization. 
	For better performance, custom serialization scheme can be designed efficiently if we know the 
	target object structure. Need to implement com.offheap.cache.util.ISerializer. 
	Default using Kryo library (dependency)
